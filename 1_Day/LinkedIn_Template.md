### 💻 Day 1/90 – Babua DSA Patterns Course 🚀

Today marks the beginning of my **90 Days DSA Patterns Journey** with [Anuj Kumar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anuj-kumar-9a188968/) (Instructor) via his YouTube channel [**CTO Bhaiya**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrJ9A_U_e4-p5ZdDOjsa1KA) 🎯


📘 **Topic learned:** *Two Pointer Pattern*
This is one of the most versatile and powerful techniques used in DSA.
Here’s what I learned today:

* Two pointers are used to traverse linear data structures like arrays, strings, or linked lists.
* They can move **towards each other**, **away from each other**, or **in the same direction** (fast–slow).
* It’s especially useful for problems like:

  * Checking **palindromes** efficiently (O(n) instead of O(n²))
  * Finding pairs that sum to a target
  * Removing duplicates or merging sorted arrays
  * Detecting cycles or finding the middle node in linked lists
* The best part? It’s **in-place** and **space-efficient** — no extra arrays or unnecessary iterations!

🧠 **Key takeaway:**
Think logically about how two pointers can meet, chase, or pass each other — and you can solve many tricky problems elegantly!
